    <h1>Cath Lab Tech</h1>
    <p class="text-primary">Invasive Cardiovascular Technology or Cath Lab Techs assist physicians with cardiac catheterization procedures. Catheterization involves inserting a small tube, known as a catheter, into a patient’s blood vessel and then into the heart.</p>

<h2>Invasive Cardiovascular Technologist</h2>
<p>
		The program is designed to develop health care professionals who, through the use of specific high technology equipment and at the discretion of a qualified physician, perform procedures on patients leading to the diagnosis and treatment of congenital and acquired heart disease.</p>

	<p>Invasive Cardiovascular Technologist students receive classroom lectures and lab training at our Palm Harbor, FL campus. ICT students also receive an extensive clinical rotation at several local hospitals that specialize in cardiovascular procedures. Students are provided with a great deal of hands-on experience while working with prominent diagnostic interventional cardiologists!</p>
   <b><p>Students are given many opportunities to observe diagnostic and interventional catheterization laboratories in action. They are allowed to observe:
  <ul> <ul>
  	<li>Diagnostic angiography studies</li>
  	<li>PTCA procedures</li>
    <li>Pacemaker implantations</li>
    <li>Invasive vascular procedures</li>
      </ul></ul></p></b>
      
      <p>ICT students are required to complete a 50 week day program. Graduates of the ICT program receive an Associates of Applied Science (AAS) degree and CPR/ACLS certification from the <a href="http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/CPRAndECC/FindaCPRClass/Find-a-CPR-Class_UCM_303220_SubHomePage.jsp" target="_blank">American Heart Association.</a>. </p>

          <p>The Department of Labor lists the mean annual wages of Cardiovascular Technologists and Technicians in 2010 were $54,550 in offices of physicians and $49,740 in general medical and surgical hospitals. They also point out that healthcare employers are interested in certified Cardiovascular Technologists, so job prospects should be best for Cardiovascular Technologists with formal training (such as that offered at Central Florida Institute).</p>
          
    <p>According to the United States Department of Labor, the employment of cardiovascular technologists and technicians is expected to increase 24 percent through the year 2018. Want to learn more about ICT employment?</p>

          <p>The students enrolled in the MA CVT program, despite having chosen a particular field of specialty in health care, are exposed to a wide variety of skills and theory within that specialty. The first term establishes a firm foundation, on which the student will build the knowledge and skills needed to further develop as he/she progresses through the program.  Some topics covered in this term will include:
        <ul><li>Cardiovascular anatomy and physiology</li>
          <li>The significance of cardiopulmonary function</li>
          <li>Cardiovascular terminology</li>
          <li>EKG rhythm interpretation</li>
          <li>12 Lead EKG fundamentals</li></ul> </p>

<p>As the student enters the second term, he/she will quickly continue to build on skills and knowledge from the previous term, as stress testing, ambulatory cardiac monitoring, and further EKG rhythm interpretational skills are emphasized. It is in this term that the student connects prior learning with newly learned skills. The student learns not only how to acquire a 12 Lead EKG, but also how to interpret it and evaluate the impact that it has on the patient’s overall health.  The student is also introduced to the specialties of echocardiography and invasive cardiovascular catheterization. </p>

<p><b>In the last term of the cardiovascular technology portion, the student learns more of the advanced skills that cardiovascular medicine has to offer. During this term the student earns certification in <a href="http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/CPRAndECC/HealthcareTraining/AdvancedCardiovascularLifeSupport/Advanced-Cardiovascular-Life-Support-_UCM_001280_SubHomePage.jsp" target="_blank">Advanced Cardiac Life Support,</a> as well as learns the importance of cardiac pacing and coagulation therapy!</b></p>
