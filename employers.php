 <p>Dr. Jim Wilcox: The consistency of that student coming out of CFI is better than I think you'll find anywhere in the workplace.</p>

<p>Lisa Morelli: CFI graduate's skills are exceptional.</p> 

<p>Dr. Latha Chamarty: I think that CFI gives excellent training in teaching students and when they graduate they have the basic skills. You still need to train them a little bit to meet your needs, so that's what we try to do for at least a month or two months. We try to train them to meet our needs. </p>

<p>Dr. Stephen Weinstock: The platform that you provide, the background and the associates degree that you give them allows them to go on much, much further in their education process.</p> 

<p>Dr. Evon Hampton: Most of our students that we've hired, they'll finish their externship on Friday, and come Monday morning, we've already put them to work. They've gone through the orientation, the hiring process ahead of time. Monday, they're no longer a student, they're an employee of ours. </p>

<p>Kathy Douglas: We have been involved with CFI for several years now and we have hired several of their students. </p>

<p>Dr. Stephen Weinstock: The platform you provide for them is a great platform because you give them the training and the basics that they need to go on from there. We're basically a learning center for these people because they haven't had a lot of ophthalmology training, but they've had such a great general background in sterile technique, how to actually handle the surgeon and how to respond to the surgeon and the surgeon's needs.</p> 

<p>They don't take things personally. I've had times in working with different scrub techs in the past who you say something, "Why'd you do that?" They just break down. They'll cry or whatever. They're not professional. I like the fact that if I criticize them and I say, in a manner that's constructive, they take it in a manner that's constructive. They don't take it personally. They say, "Oh, yes sir, I understand. I'll be able to do that from now on. Thank you very much." </p>

<p>If something's not going perfectly well during a case, they say a machine could have a failure and the surgeon could get upset, they're going to handle it in stride. I'm not going to worry about the surgical tech. I've had to do that, but with your graduates, they seem to just handle the surgeon well, as well as the patient and their duties and responsibilities.</p> 

<p>They can become whatever they want after going through your program. Frankly, basically their skill level is so high that the training involved to get them up to speed is real short term.</p> 

<p>There's an incredibly broad field. Any time they want to enter the field, to just start in an institute like yours is a great place to start. They get a degree and it's in the health field. There's a whole new world that opens up.</p>

<p>Dr. Latha Chamarty: I'm very pleased with the CFI graduates so far. They do have basic knowledge about their job. With some training we provide in our office, they're able to meet the day-to-day challenges in our office. They have training for the front office and back office, which is very important. So, most of the graduates we hire are able to do front and back office skills. </p>

<p>For our office, I think we basically would like them to do front and back office, and most of these graduates are able to do that. Also, they do externships in doctor's offices when they're in training. I think that helps them a lot to prepare for their work experience. </p>

<p>I hired our first graduate about six to seven years ago. I really got impressed by the way that she has worked in the past. She worked for me full time. She was really very helpful. Always have been trying to reach CFI since then if I need someone to be hired. I'm not looking anywhere else. </p>

<p>Dr. Jim Wilcox: Before we started using CFI students, I often had positions open for more than a year because I couldn't find a qualified practitioner. Now I have a resource. I've gotten most of my positions filled.</p> 

<p>Well, the job market has contracted a little bit, but the CFI graduate, because they are credentialed, has a special niche that they can fill. They also can pass their professional exam the first time around, which means there's no delay, or very little delay, between the point that they graduate from school and can walk in as a credentialed practitioner.</p> 

<p>Dr. Evon Hampton: The graduates that we have now, we actually had them as students. So we had them for six months. We trained them, hands-on. They were able to sit for their registry prior to graduating. Because CFI has maintained their accreditation, therefore, those candidates we're going to put in front of anybody else. </p>

<p>They have done a great job here in purchasing equipment that you would see in a physician's office today. The students are in the lab often, hands-on, standing with the instructors, right there aiding them. So when they come in, they've had that hands-on application. You can't reproduced that.</p> 

<p>Kathy Douglas: CFI provides an excellent knowledge base and skill level for their students, which enables them to enter the medical field and adapt quickly to the clinical setting. The CFI students definitely come with a high level of skill and a huge knowledge base, which then we like to take and turn and have them grow from that point. That also helps in the training process, which makes it seamless from going from student to healthcare worker.</p> 

<p>We have hired several CFI students over the past six years. They demonstrated great work ethic, a desire to learn. We're in cardiology, it's a never-ending learning. You're forever the student.</p> 

<p>The reputation of CFI is an excellent one. We have been very successful in our affiliation with their program in hiring their students and the continuing externship programs that we hold at All Children's Hospital. We've had wonderful success. They have top notch students here.</p> 

<p>Lisa Morelli: We've had a relationship with CFI for several years. We use them in their externships with the hopes to hire afterwards. </p>

<p>CFI graduates, if they've worked in our facility, they can start working as a full time employee the day they graduate. They seem to fit in really well. They have great education and professionalism. </p>

<p>We've hired, probably, between eight to ten of your students over the last ten years.</p> 

<p>Toni DiCristo: Right when I walked into my job I could do everything because I remembered everything from what I learned here. My front office class taught me everything I needed to know about front office. Filing, I can remember everything, because I do it now. So, I'd have to very quickly. . .</p> 

<p>Hands-on training was probably the best, because if you go to some schools you don't get hands-on training. They do the classes and then go out. The hands-on training was probably the best part because you got to actually draw people's blood, not get pushed out into the field and do it for the first time on a patient. You got to do it here, or learn how to do blood pressures here. Everything was learned here, so it's much better than just online classes which isn't a lot of help for me, personally. </p>

<p>I would tell them how I felt about it, how I felt when I came in, how everybody was warm and nice and welcoming, the hands-on experience, the teachers, how they helped me find a job afterwards. Everything. I've had the best experience here that I could say. I've actually told a couple friends about this place already. Some of them actually are enrolled and go to school now.</p>
