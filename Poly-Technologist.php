<h4>AAS degree | 14-month program | CAAHEP accredited | Palm Harbor, FL</h4>

<p>Polysomnography is the scientific evaluation of sleep and represents the premier standard in sleep study diagnostics and treatment assessment. A Polysomnographic Technologist (PSG Tech or Sleep Tech) works with a team to diagnose and treat patients with sleep disorders by performing overnight polysomnograms on those with suspected sleep disorders. The Polysomnographic Technologist program at CFI, prepares graduates for careers in the growing field of sleep disorders.</p> 

<p>The program is designed to provide students with the theory and clinical practice to prepare them as competent entry-level Polysomnographic Technologists in the cognitive (knowledge), psychomotor (skills), and affective (behavior) learning domains. The curriculum includes cardiopulmonary anatomy and physiology, normal and abnormal sleep patterns, and diagnostic and therapeutic techniques.</p>
         
   <p>PSG Technologists perform the following duties:
   <ul>
	    <li>Perform sleep studies</li>
	    <li>Compile results for physician</li>
	    <li>Monitor, collect, and analyze data</li>
	    <li>Educate patient before and after study</li>   
	    <li>Patient preparation with electrodes and breathing equipment</li>
	    <li>Coordinate treatment plan and instruct patient regarding treatment plan</li>
	    <li>Operate, monitor, and troubleshoot computerized sleep equipment while patient is sleeping</li>
	    <li>Work closely with physicians and other sleep specialists participating in patient education</li>
  </ul>
  
    <p>Clinical and externship experiences are conducted at hospitals and sleep-disorders centers so students gain experience performing sleep studies in a clinical setting.</p>
    
    <p>Polysomnographic Technologist students are required to complete *60.5 credit hours (approximately 60 weeks or 1350 clock hours).         Graduates of the Polysomnographic Technologist program receive an Associates of Applied Science (AAS) degree and CPR certification from the <a href="http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/CPRAndECC/FindaCPRClass/Find-a-CPR-Class_UCM_303220_SubHomePage.jsp" target="_blank">American Heart Association.</a> Full-time students can complete the program in 14 months and take evening classes.</p>
    
<p class="disclaimer"> *The listing of credits is not meant to imply that credits can be transferred into college or other private career school programs. Transfer credits are at the sole discretion of the receiving school.</p>

    		 <p>The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics does not collect employment or earnings data on polysomnographic technologists. However, the Board of Registered Polysomnographic Technologists (BRPT) estimates that there are more than 7,000 registered technologists internationally. And the Association of Polysomnographic Technologists (APT), in a 2003 survey, found that polysomnographic  technologists had biweekly earnings averaging $1,719, with registered technologists earning slightly more than their non-credentialed counterparts.</p>

          <p>Polysomnography continues to reveal new information. Many clues to sleep related disorders, which were once over looked are now being used to better understand and define sleep patterns, sleep-related breathing pathologies, EEG arousals, and movement disorders. The range of sleep disorders is varied, but includes such common disorders as:</p>
         <ul>
	        <li>Seizures</li>
	        <li>Insomnias (inability to sleep)</li>
	        <li>Sleep apneas (airway gets closed off during sleep)</li>
	        <li>Narcolepsy (sudden attacks of sleep or loss of muscle tone)</li>
	        <li>Parasomnias (abnormal behaviors or movements during sleep, such as sleep walking and nightmares)</li>
        </ul>
        
         <p>Polysomnography is a study to determine if a person has a sleep disorder that is harmful to their health. It requires an overnight stay in a sleep laboratory. While patients sleep, they are monitored with various equipment including:</p>
             
             <ul>
           	 <li><b>Electroencephalography (EEG)</b> - The electroencephalograph records brain wave 
                activity from different parts of the brain and charts them on a graph. The EEG 
                helps establish what stage of sleep the patient is in and may also detect 
                seizures.</li>

			 <li><b>Continuous Electro-Oculography (EOG) </b>- This records eye movement and is used to 
                  determine when the patient is going through a stage of sleep called 
                  rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. Both EEG and EOG help determine how much time it 
                  takes for a person to fall asleep, total sleep time, the time spent in each 
                  sleep stage, and the number of arousals from sleep.</li>

			  <li><b>Thermistor or Thermocouple</b> – This heat sensitive device measures the air flow 
               through the patient's nose and mouth. This can help detect periods of when 
               breathing is stopped (apnea) or inadequate breathing (hypnopea).</li>

			  <li><b>Pulse Oximetry</b> – This measures the amount of oxygen in the blood.&nbsp; It is used to 
            determine the degree of oxygen starvation during episodes of apnea or hypnopea.</li>

            	<li><b>Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG)</b> - The electrical activity of the patient's heart 
            is also measured on an ECG. This helps to detect abnormal heart rhythms (cardiac 
            arrythmias), which may occur during periods of sleep apnea. Blood pressure is 
            also measured, as sometimes sleep apnea can dangerously elevate blood pressure.</li>

           	 <li><b>Electromyogram (EMG)</b> - The movement of limbs may be monitored during 
            sleep. This can be helpful in detecting such sleep disorders as periodic 
            limb movements and restless leg syndrome.</li>
