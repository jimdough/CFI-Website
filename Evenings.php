 		<p>Coming to school at night gives a student a lot of opportunity to have a
life during the day, whether they have family they have to take care of,
whether they have work commitments. It also provides an opportunity if the
student has to care for somebody or if they have a sick parent. So, nights
really maximizes the day better.</p>

<p>From a waitress at your local restaurant to someone that works in a
manufacturing warehouse, we get a lot of people that are moving out of the
real estate field and mortgage field areas that right now are not as
productive as the healthcare careers.</p>

<p>You can still take care of your family. You can take them to school. You
can pick them up. You can help them with their homework, get them ready for
the night, cook dinner or get dinner ready, and have everything done and
you still have time to come to school at 6:00.</p>

<p>People don't think about going to school at night because a lot of times
many of these programs are assumed that they're only offered during the
day. Being that we all have a lot of responsibilities, really maximizing
those hours in the evening, which maybe you spend it on Facebook, maybe you
spend it watching TV, maybe you spend it gaming or really not using your
time as best as you could utilize it. If you take that short amount of time
in the evening, those five hours, and you do something productive with
those five hours, it's going to benefit you in definitely more ways one.</p>
