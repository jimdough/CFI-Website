 <h3>Rasmussen College Partnership with Central Florida Institute</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.rasmussen.edu/"><img border="0" style="padding:10px;" alt="Rasmussen College Logo" src="images/Rasmussen-College-Logo.jpg" width="250" align="right" /></a>Central Florida Institute is excited to offer current students and graduates the opportunity to seamlessly transition academic credits to a regionally-accredited college or university. Our partner, Rasmussen College, is committed to helping health professionals advance their education by connecting CFI students with accredited colleges and universities.</p>

<p>At Rasmussen College we make higher education a successful investment.  Our tuition is straightforward, affordable and locked.  Our graduates have an 85% in-filed success rate and we offer Central Florida Institute graduates transfer policies that save you money.  Rasmussen College is regionally accredited by the <a href="http://www.ncahlc.org" target="_blank">Higher Learning Commission</a> and a member of the <a href="http://www.northcentralassociation.org" target="_blank">North Central Association of Colleges and Schools</a>, so you know our curriculum upholds the highest academic standards.</p>

<p>As a CFI alumni you can transfer into our <a href="http://www.rasmussen.edu/degrees/business/healthcare-management/">Healthcare Management Bachelor’s program</a> or one of our many <a href="http://www.rasmussen.edu/degrees/" target="_blank">Accelerated Bachelor’s programs</a> and complete your degree in as little as 18 months.</p>

<h3>About Rasmussen College:</h3>

<p>Our <a href="http://www.rasmussen.edu/why-rasmussen/student-support/" target="_blank">SUPPORT+ Services Help Students Succeed</a> -- SUPPORT+, our network of student support services, helps ensure every Rasmussen College student achieves the academic and career success they want.</p>

<p>Our Classroom Experience Replicates the Real World -- In small classes with industry-experienced faculty who have a first-hand understanding of the strategies, tactics, and everyday demands of their field, students receive hands-on learning and gain advanced and relevant career skills and insight.</p>

<p>Technology Enhances Our Student Learning Experience -- To make our programs available to students across the country—and in a format that helps students more closely connect with their faculty and fellow students—we implemented several new technologically advanced learning platforms.</p>

<p>Our Tuition Is Locked In -- At Rasmussen College, we instituted a Tuition Lock, which guarantees tuition costs will not increase for continuously enrolled students—from enrollment through graduation. Tuition Lock gives peace of mind to continuously enrolled students that their tuition costs will remain constant—and not increase—so they can focus on their coursework and graduation.</p>
